# walk-and-relate
Code for the paper Walk-and-Relate: A Random-Walk-based Algorithm for Representation Learning on Sparse Knowledge Graphs

The code is built on top of the [DGL-KE](https://github.com/awslabs/dgl-ke) Library.
1. The file count_metapath_instances.py generates the metapaths and the metapath-information. Please look at the ArgParser class for a decription of the inputs to the python script.
2. The file run_model.py estimates the KG embeddings. Please look at the ArgParser class for a decription of the inputs to the python script.
